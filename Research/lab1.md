## 1. Research Topic

**Title:** Visualization-Oriented Logs for Debugging Distributed Systems

**Description:**  
The project proposes a new approach to debugging distributed systems by creating **visualization-oriented logs** 
that capture essential metadata to simulate and visualize the system's execution. The goal is to provide a clear 
and interactive representation of the distributed system’s behavior, enabling engineers and researchers to understand
complex interactions, identify bottlenecks, and detect subtle errors. The visualization structure can leverage existing
system specifications, such as Kubernetes manifests, to organize the representation. The prototype will focus on 
generating and visualizing logs for small-scale distributed systems or simulated clusters.
