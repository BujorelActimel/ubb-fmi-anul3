## 1. Research Topic

**Title:** VIR – Visualization-Oriented Intermediate Representation for Language-Agnostic Program Understanding

**Description:**  
The project proposes a language-agnostic intermediate representation (VIR) that captures program execution 
semantics to enable visualization of control flow, data flow, and state changes. VIR allows any programming 
language or DSL to emit a unified IR, which can then be rendered in interactive visualizations for educational, 
debugging, or research purposes. The prototype will include a frontend for a small language and a simple 
visualization backend.
