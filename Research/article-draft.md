## 3. Related Work

**Debugging Approaches:** Dao et al. [1] introduced MaceODB, an online debugging tool that verifies properties during the execution of distributed systems. Their work demonstrates the importance of runtime state capture and property verification, concepts fundamental to visualization-oriented logging.

**Visual Debugging Techniques:** Hoffswell et al. [2] described visual debugging techniques for reactive data visualizations, including timeline views, replay capabilities, and state inspection. These interactive exploration methods are directly applicable to visualizing distributed system logs.

**Comprehensive Debugging Frameworks:** Beschastnikh et al. [3] provided a comprehensive overview of challenges and methods for debugging distributed systems, including log analysis and visualization. Their work in [4] presents ShiViz, a complete platform for visualization and debugging based on time-space diagrams and vector clocks, offering concrete solutions for capturing and visualizing distributed executions.

**Fully-Distributed Debugging:** Chalopin et al. [5] presented ViSiDiA, a platform for simulation, visualization, and debugging of distributed algorithms in anonymous networks, addressing fully-distributed debugging without identifiers or synchronization.
